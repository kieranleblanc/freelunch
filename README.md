# Free Lunch

Free Lunch tries to connect people who have surplus food with people who need it. 

**Mission**

The mission of Free Lunch is to make it easy to find free surplus food, in order to cut food waste and help people eat well for less. In future we hope to develop a companion app to alert users to nearby listings.

**Availability**

Free Lunch is still under development. You can sign up through our staging site [here](https://freelunchapp.herokuapp.com) but at the moment we can't guarantee the website will always be available (or that it will work).

**Contributions**

We'll review any reasonably small pull requests.
